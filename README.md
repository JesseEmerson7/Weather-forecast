#Weather-forecast

## description

This website displays Weather information for the current day and also a five-day forecast. Searching a city brings up all the weather information you would need to plan a future trip. A search history is also saved and can be used to search the same city name again.

This site takes advantage of RESTful API’s and JavaScript to dynamically display an accurate weather forecast.

## Instructions and Usage

No installation required.

Once on the main page the user is presented with a weather dashboard. Any city name can be entered in the search bar on the left side of the screen. Click search and weather conditions will be displayed for the current day and a five-day forecast. All past searches will be logged in the "history" section located under the search bar. Click the city name button and that past search will be reapplied to the page.
